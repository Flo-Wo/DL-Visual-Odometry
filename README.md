# Visual odemetry using Deep Learning
In this project we try to estimate the velocity of a car using Deep Learning methods. We tried
using optical flow (Farneback pyramid method) and a siamese approach with two consecutive
frames as input.

We used the [comma ai speedchallenge](https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge) to gather data and trained our models
on (different) splits of the test video.
