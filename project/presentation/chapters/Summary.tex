\section{Summary and demo}
\begin{frame}{Summary and outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item So far good results and quite promising models\\
$\Rightarrow$ Short demo video
\item Still a lot work to do, to get a truly convincing model
\item Currently working on own data gathering and brightness/contrast augmentation to improve and 
generalize models\\
$\Rightarrow$ Idea: pick the so far best (two) model(s) and train them on the bigger and augmented dataset
\end{itemize}
