	\begin{itemize}
		\item One could use a similar setup as for acquiring the test data, to achieve a live prediction
		\item To test our predictions we wrote a method reading a video and predicting the speed
		\item Even with calculating the optical flow we reached a speed of 30 fps $\Rightarrow$ live prediction would be possible
		\item At the moment there is no completely convincing model
		%\item a lot of programming would be involved
