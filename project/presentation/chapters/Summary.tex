\section{Summary and application ideas}

\begin{frame}{Usability in real world application}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item using a similar setup as for acquiring the test data it would be possible to achieve a live prediction
		\item to test our predictions we wrote a method reading a video and predicting the speed
		\item even with calculating the optical flow we reached a speed of 30 fps $\Rightarrow$ live prediction would be possible
		\item at the moment there is no completely convincing model
		\item a lot of programming would be involved
	\end{itemize}
