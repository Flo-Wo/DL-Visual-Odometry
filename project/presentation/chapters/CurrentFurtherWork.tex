\subsection{Additional noise}
\begin{frame}{Contrast and brightness augmentation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Additional noise to frames \textbf{before} calculating the flow field.
\item Change the brightness and contrast of an image via
\begin{align*}
\text{frame}_{\mathrm{augmented}}(i,j) = \alpha(i,j) \cdot \text{frame}(i,j) + \beta(i,j)
\end{align*}
with functions $\alpha$ (contrast: $>1$ increase, $<1$ decrease) and $\beta$ (brightness).\\
To get some noise into the frames, we used
\begin{align*}
\alpha &\sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)+0.35\\
\beta &\sim \mathcal{U}(-5,35),
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{U}(a,b)$ is the uniform distribution in an interval $[a,b]$ for $a < b$.

\begin{frame}{Acquire more data}
	\textbf{Method}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item using simple methods it is still possible to create more data in good quality
		\item video producing and velocity detection can be done with common apps
		\item we were using \textit{open camera} and \textit{open street maps}
		\item using GPS tracking for velocity detection (exportable as \texttt{.gpx}-file)
		\item using the time stamps and interpolation both files can be combined to one data set
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Advantages and Issues}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item very easy method to create a lot of data
		\item velocity has some uncertainties (needs to be interpolated to cover all frames; uncertainties of GPS)
		\item frame rate differs a little from original data (24 fps vs 20 fps)
	\end{itemize}Â´

\begin{frame}{Evaluation with the test video}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item rough check how model performs on unseen video with the same parameters
		\item no labels available so we can only compare key situations (stops, highway, ...)
		\item some models achieve at least a qualitative accordance with the video (hier noch ein Bild)
		\item best networks: altered original network and
